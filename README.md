# Mini Relational Database

### "What I cannot create, I do not understand." — Richard Feynman

Feynman thought that true understanding comes from building things from scratch... so I built the thing that confused me the most.

### Features
- B+ Trees for efficient indexing and data retrieval
- Concurrency with atomic operations for parallel transactions
- OLTP Techniques for fast and responsive queries

### Why Build This?
Because I can. And because databases aren't just magical boxes. This project was built to demystify how relational databases manage transactions, indexing, and concurrent operations.

### Lessons Learned
Building this database reinforced the idea that concepts like B+ trees, ACID transactions, and concurrency aren’t just abstract theories. While at first, they seem intimidating, they can be pretty interesting when implemented.
